 
 When a Rigidbody is moving slower than a defined minimum linear or rotational speed, the physics engine assumes it has come to a halt. When this happens, the GameObject does not move again until it receives a collision or force, and so it is set to "sleeping" mode. This optimisation means that no processor time is spent updating the Rigidbody until the next time it is “awoken” (that is, set in motion again).
